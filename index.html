 				<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887 in the town of Erode, in Tamil Nadu, in the south east of India. His father was K. Srinivasa Iyengar, an accounting clerk for a clothing merchant. His mother was Komalatammal, who earned a small amount of money each month as a singer at the local temple.</p>
 				<h3 class="dv-sub" style="color:crimson">Career as a Mathemitician</h3>
 				<p>Considered to be a mathematical genius, Srinivasa Ramanujan, was regarded at par with the likes of Leonhard Euler and Carl Jacobi. Along with Hardy, he studied the partition function P(n) extensively and gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. Their work led to the development of a new method for finding asymptotic formulae, called the circle method.</p>
 				<h3 class="dv-sub" style="color: crimson">Writings</h3>
 				<p>He compiled 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations), before he lost his life at the age of 32. His infinite series for pi was one of his most celebrated findings.</p>
 				<h3 class="dv-sub" style="color:crimson">Legacy</h3>
 				<p>His birthday, 22 December, is celebrated as 'State IT Day' in his home state of Tamil Nadu. On the 125th anniversary of his birth, India declared his birthday as 'National Mathematics Day'.</p>
 				<h3 class="dv-sub" style="color:crimson">The man who knew Infinity </h3>
 				<p>A biography of Ramanujan titled The Man Who Knew Infinity was published in 1991 and a movie of the same name starring Dev Patel as Ramanujan and Jeremy Irons as Hardy, premiered in September 2015 at the Toronto Film Festival.</p>

            <p>"Srinivasa Ramanujan was the strangest man in all of mathematics, probably in the entire history of science. He has been compared to a bursting supernova, illuminating the darkest, most profound corners of mathematics, before being tragically struck down by tuberculosis at the age of 33... Working in total isolation from the main currents of his field, he was able to rederive 100 years’ worth of Western mathematics on his own. The tragedy of his life is that much of his work was wasted rediscovering known mathematics. "</p>
